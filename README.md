This guide has practices and patterns for writing CSS. It helps us give more consistency to our projects and improve the quality. As a consequence, it makes our projects more maintanable and scalable.

### How to contribute

You should feel free to contribute with Pull Requests.

To help you with your contributions, it is nice to follow this structure when possible:
- When should you use the documented practice?
- What is this practice?
- What are some applied examples? (both right and wrong)
- Why is this the best solution? It's nice to have references here.
- What are other diverging approaches, and why not use them?

## Run this project

This project was created using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/).
It would be nice to install Jekyll if you'd like to contribute with new content.

_If you contribution is only with minor changes, you can do it without installing Jekyll._

### Besides installing Jekyll

This application uses a [git submodule repository](https://github.com/flama/flama-pages-style) that stores styles used by Jekyll.

**After cloning run this command to register submodules**
```shell
git submodule init
```

**Then run this command to pull all new files**
```shell
git submodule update
```
