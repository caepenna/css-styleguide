### Column grid

**Why columns? When to use?**
Ë›
We believe in consistency, but also in a content-fluid decision. So that's why we built our own column grid system which should be used only in cases that you have to organize the content based not only on better interactions (_later discussion in responsive layout_), but also in a hierarchy-based decision or more readable experience instead.

Columns are our response to a project whenever he needs to set a better hierarchy, readable experience or even a consistent interaction.

**Our Solution**

What we aimed to do was create a framework that could work inside any container, regardless of the width of the container. The variables we needed were: number of columns and gutter, and the column width would be adapted accoringly.

Our solution is a SCSS based system, and a _mixin_, _include_ and _calc_ structure that could be set in any layout/component (_Later discussion in stylesheets and folder architecture_) that relies in two variables at first: number of columns and gutter.

It also include custom settings for any other working screen you might be working with. It works by setting up a minimum screen size for tablet or mobile and later working out the columns, gutter variables for those screens.  

**How to use?**

1. First things first: get to know your variables.
  * The code is really simple. And it will start as two variables only: _number of columns_ and _gutter_;

  ```scss
  $nOfColumns: 12; !default
  $gutter: 1rem; !default
  $columnWidth: ( 100%/#{$nOfColumns} - #{$gutter} );
  ```

  * You will notice that same variables happens for _tablets_ and _mobile_;

  ```scss
  $nOfColumnsTablet: 8; !default
  $gutterTablet: .5rem; !default
  $columnWidthTablet: ( 100%/#{$nOfColumnsTablet} - #{$gutterTablet} );

  $nOfColumnsMobile: 4; !default
  $gutterMobile: .5rem; !default
  $columnWidthMobile: ( 100%/#{$nOfColumnsMobile} - #{$gutterMobile} );
  ```

  * And then, set up your maximum tablet and mobile width;

  ```scss
  $tabletWidth: 640px; !default
  $mobileWidth: 480px; !default
  ```

2. Second stuff comes right after: get to know the system.
  * There you'll see a bunch of _mixins_ for mobile and tablet. They will be setting up the grid the way it should be based on the variables you have set before. Apply it using **@include grid(number)**;

  * And also, there will be set some offset mixins in case you might wanna get off the grid for some reason. Apply it using **@include offSetRight(number)** or **@includeOffSetLeft(number)**;

3. Not all set, yet! Set up your container width too.
  * Mind that the grid works without setting a width, but it might be compromise the overall look of the application and it's certainly not the best approach for a multiple screen application.

  ```scss
  .container {
    width: calc(60% + 240px); !default
    max-width: 100%;
    margin-right: auto;
    margin-left: auto;
    overflow: auto;
  }
  ```

4. All set! You're good to go!

There's no wrong feedback from now on and we'd love to actually know your overall experience with the system.


### Vertical grid module

In design, _vertical rhythm_ is the structure that guides a reader's eye through the content. Consistent vertical rhythm makes a layout more balanced and its content more readable.

In order to ensure a consistent vertical rythim, we use a vertical grid module which is half the size of the `html`'s `font-size`, set in `em`. This means every* vertical distance should be a multiple of `0.5em`.

*There can be exceptions (needs further explaining).

**Right**

```scss
html {font-size: 16px;}

p {line-height: 1rem;}

.foo {height: 2.5rem;}
```

**Wrong**

```scss
p {line-height: 17px;}

.foo {height: 2.4rem;}
```
